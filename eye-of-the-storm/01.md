# [Eye of the Storm](index)

## Chapter 1 - Tempest

There was a small hill behind the Inn. Neil often walked there after hours, just to sit alone. He looked up at the sky, at the two bright points of light. The sun whale, and Tia. The new addition to the night sky hadn't been there for long. It was only a few months ago that all that craziness happened, with the undead army and the nightsky falling and -

"Hey."

Neil froze. It wasn't like him to let someone sneak up on him like that. But then he relaxed, it was someone he was comfortable with, to a degree. "How'd you find me?"

"I'm a ranger, you know. Even if you're the best rogue around, I can still find you" They paused for a second, a smirk forming. "You pick off bits of bushes as you walk past when you're anxious." They took a couple steps towards him. "I've been wondering where you kept going off to after closing times. You just looked sad. I... I thought you might like my company. Is that ok?"

He thought for a second. Well, hesitated. He knew the answer but struggled to verbalize it. He patted the ground by his side. Fable sat, glanced at him. Brushed his knee with their hand. Then just sat there in silence. Fable was a calm in the storm for him, the epicenter that kept all of his swirling, tempestuous thoughts together. He swallowed to wet his throat. Then the words just started falling out of his mouth. About Tia, about the whole thing with Quasar, about how he's not used to being around so many people all the time, about how he's not used to being *close* to someone. Not like this.

"I... I..."

Fable *listened* to him like nobody else would, except maybe the Innkeeper. They understood him. They shuffled into him. Their head on his shoulder, hands grasped. He could feel them breathing, their heartbeat. They made him feel so comfortable. The wind blew in his hair. By now, the sun had gone down. It was dark. He could see their breath mingling in the cool air, misting together. It caught in his throat. He felt their head move on his shoulder, like they were looking at him. It seemed the moment stretched on forever.

"I love you, Neil."

He stood up. Fable fell to the ground, catching themselves. He was shaking, and he wasn't sure why. He couldn't stop it. They shook, too. The way they looked up at Neil. Confused. Maybe hurt. He looked away, quickly. He couldn't take it. Neil stood there, frozen in shock and fear and whatever else was in his system.

He ran.

"NEIL!"

He kept going.

"Neil.." quieter, now. He needed to be alone.

---

He sat at the bar. Brooding. As always, some might say. The Innkeeper, always a steady source of good advice and comfort, was polishing a glass. Nobody else was there, not this early. He waited for the Innkeeper to make a comment, or a question, or a wisecrack. Anything to break the silence.

"Rough night, Neil? You look like you haven't slept. Are you okay?"

"..." Neil paused to recollect his thoughts. "Fable and I..." Neil coughed. The Innkeeper was busying themselves with other tasks, but Neil knew that they were just giving him the time he needed. There wasn't a rush.

"We were in a fight. I guess."

"You guess?"

"I... no, I just ran away. Are they here?" Neil whispered.

"No, they must have headed home after close. I only have Archi and Melli staying here tonight. How are you feeling?"

"I'm not sure." Neil stopped for a second. "They headed home? I... we were out stargazing. Are you sure they're ok? Have you seen them?" Neil's mind raced with a million possibilities. Maybe they got lost? No, they'd never get lost... Maybe they would? Maybe they got attacked by a bear, and he was too far away to help. He buried his face into his hands, leaned into the bar. It was his fault.

"Are you okay?" Melli was tugging at his sleeves, reaching up from the floor. She had morning voice, still in her pajamas, carrying a doll of Rufus, the Sheepfish. "Just breathe, Neil." She kept a hand on him as she eased onto her spot on the bar. Her large eyes trained on him.

"Fable. They might be in danger."

"What happened?"

"I don't know! Anything could have happened, they could have..."

"Hey. Start with the facts, tell me what you know and we can go from there. We're detectives, remember?"

Neil stopped. Remembered what he had worked on with Clay. He laid his hands on his legs, planted his feet on the ground, brought his chin up, and breathed. Five seconds out, five seconds in, hold for five. Then again. "Fable. They were with me last night, in the wilderness. They might be in trouble." What he was feeling was written all over his face, he was sure. How worried he was.

Melli smiled, beamed even. Maybe she was keeping the mood up, or maybe this is just how she is. "Sounds like a case for Great Detective Melli! Let's go see what happened, assistant!" Neil looked to Melli. She had done a lot of growing over the past couple months. It felt strange to look up to such a young kid, but they've been teaching each other a lot since they've met. "I'll change into my detective gear, you better be ready by the time I get back down!" Melli punched Neil on the shoulder, playfully, then scampered up the stairs on all fours, leaving the ersatz Rufus behind.

"Ow!" Neil grinned. He picked up the doll, fiddled with it. He was rather proud of this one. It's made with his wool. Seems to have held up well, even with Melli's hijinks. He ran his fingers over the surface, and fidgeted with the legs.

After a moment of silence, The Innkeeper chimed in. "Sounds like a *quest*. Do you need a drink? I know just the one."

Neil nodded.

The Innkeeper quickly made a Spoken Heart. Neil would never admit it, but it's become his favorite drink.

---

They walked in silence towards the spot, each of Neil's long strides matched by two of Melli's. It was a companionable silence, a focused one. Neil had to point out a few hidden shortcuts and tracks, but Melli was comfortable in this terrain. It was a spring morning cold, the chill while the sun rises. Dew collected on their boots as they strode past.

"We're here." There wasn't a huge scene of destruction. Everything was basically as Neil left it. Even the track he made as he ran away. Coward.

"Neil, what happened?"

He recounted the events of last night. Melli kept herself busy with looking around, but had an ear trained on him as he leaned against a tree, broodingly.

"Fable tried to follow you, but gave up around... here. Looks like they just went home. Nothing terrible happened!" Melli shrugged, saw Neil still rather glum. "Don't worry, they know what's up!"

"What should we do?"

Melli paused for a second. "You", jabbing a finger at Neil's midsection "need to go talk to them. Come, let's go!"

Melli strode off on a trot, following Fable's trail.

Neil wasn't used to thinking about other people. For almost his whole life, it was just him. He needed to make things right. It's not some big evil monster, it was just them two. But he'd never felt such fear in his whole life. He could handle big evil monsters, but this was a whole new territory.

---

Fable's place was a small cottage, nestled amongst a copse of trees, a few miles from the Wayfarer's Inn.

"They got home safe, but they might not have gotten much sleep either!" Melli looked up at Neil, grabbed his forearm with both her paws. "Will you be ok by yourself?"

Neil nodded.

"Well... I'll be back at the flat. Let me know how it goes, okay?" She punched his arm, playfully. "Go get em, tiger!"

Then, it was just Neil standing outside of Fable's cottage. Absently, he found himself braiding his own hair. Almost like he was just hoping that Fable would open the door of their own accord and find him standing there and then everything would be fine after that. But he resolved. If he wanted this... then he needed to act like it. He brought his hand up, and knocked on the door.

Some minutes went by, then he knocked again. The door opened, and Fable was there, wearing a plain white shift.

"Hey. I-"

Fable smiled, then lunged forward into a hug. Neil couldn't do anything but catch them, his arms resting on their back. Fable looked up at him. Their eyes were puffy, their hair was messy. Tearfully, they began "I'm sorry..", and sobbed into Neil's chest. He didn't have any words for them, it took everything in him to not just bolt. He couldn't find the words in him, nothing that sounded real enough.

Muffled, Fable cried "I didn't know if you'd come back..." Neil felt the muscles around his heart start to cramp up. How could he have done this to them? Nothing made him run. Nothing but him, his own fear and insecurity.

"I'm here now. It's okay. You're fine. I'm here." It wasn't enough. He knew it wasn't enough, he knew that he wasn't enough. In a near whisper, he squeezed out "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you. I shouldn't have left you like that. I was so worried." Neil pressed them closer, kissed them on the crown of their head. There wasn't anything else he thought to say. They stood like that for a while, in the cold morning frost. Neil's shirt grew wet from tears, but still he didn't let go.

Fable pulled away first, leaned back, looked him in the eyes. He couldn't look away. After the dragon's influence, their eyes sparkled like opals in moonlight. They took a step back towards the door, opened it, and stepped just inside the jamb. Neil stood still, unsure of what to do. Still shakey from the crying, and hesitant, Fable invited Neil "Do you want to come in?"

He took a step forwards, then another. Then closed the door behind him, leaving behind the cold.
