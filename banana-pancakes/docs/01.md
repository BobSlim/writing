The plane angles down, sharply. You close your eyes and take a sharp breath, holding it. You focus on chewing your gum as the plane hits the ground and comes to a stop over the runway. You open your eyes, and everyone's already standing up, clawing at their luggage. Looking outside the window, Bangkok airport looks... like an airport, basically. Control towers, asphalt, buses. The sky is clear, it's around midday.

You sigh, and will the tension to dissolve from your body and seep through your feet into the plane. You don't like flying. When you open your eyes, the attendant motions you towards exiting via the front door. You grab your stuff and join the end of the queue heading out of the plane. The stairs to disembark are rickety, and shake on each step you take down. When you enter the bus, there's just one seat available, in the very back left corner. You shuffle in, awkwardly.

Your seatmate. "Hey". A soft voice, not at all intrusive. You were in the middle of putting in your earbuds, but pause. Their voice sounds familiar."Getting away from it all, too?" She pauses. "Well, I guess if that's true, you wouldn't want to see someone like me here. Still, I'm glad you're taking some time for yourself." She smiles at you. "It's been a while, you know?"

WHAT?
- Put your earbuds away, and catch up.
- Greet politely, then put your earbuds in.
