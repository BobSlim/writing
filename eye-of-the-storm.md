A Tavern Talk fanfic featuring the Neil Brume / Fable Verifina

Shoutout to [@BluePirs](https://www.twitch.tv/bluepirs) for having me along on her playthrough of the game, during which I have come to adore these characters and the setting.

Generally *low intimacy*, but your mileage may vary.

There was a small hill behind the Inn. Neil often walked there after hours, just to sit alone. He looked up at the sky, at the two bright points of light. The sun whale, and Tia. The new addition to the night sky hadn't been there for long. It was only a few months ago that all that craziness happened, with the undead army and the nightsky falling and -

"Hey."

Neil froze. It wasn't like him to let someone sneak up on him like that. But then he relaxed, it was someone he was comfortable with, to a degree. "How'd you find me?"

"I'm a ranger, you know. Even if you're the best rogue around, I can still find you" They paused for a second, a smirk forming. "You pick off bits of bushes as you walk past when you're anxious." They took a couple steps towards him. "I've been wondering where you kept going off to after closing times. You just looked sad. I... I thought you might like my company. Is that ok?"

He thought for a second. Well, hesitated. He knew the answer but struggled to verbalize it. He patted the ground by his side. Fable sat, glanced at him. Brushed his knee with their hand. Then just sat there in silence. Fable was a calm in the storm for him, the epicenter that kept all of his swirling, tempestuous thoughts together. He swallowed to wet his throat. Then the words just started falling out of his mouth. About Tia, about the whole thing with Quasar, about how he's not used to being around so many people all the time, about how he's not used to being *close* to someone. Not like this.

"I... I..."

Fable *listened* to him like nobody else would, except maybe the Innkeeper. They understood him. They shuffled into him. Their head on his shoulder, hands grasped. He could feel them breathing, their heartbeat. They made him feel so comfortable. The wind blew in his hair. By now, the sun had gone down. It was dark. He could see their breath mingling in the cool air, misting together. It caught in his throat. He felt their head move on his shoulder, like they were looking at him. It seemed the moment stretched on forever.

"I love you, Neil."

He stood up. Fable fell to the ground, catching themselves. He was shaking, and he wasn't sure why. He couldn't stop it. They shook, too. The way they looked up at Neil. Confused. Maybe hurt. He looked away, quickly. He couldn't take it. Neil stood there, frozen in shock and fear and whatever else was in his system. 

He ran.

"NEIL!"

He kept going.

"Neil.." quieter, now. He needed to be alone.

---

He sat at the bar. Brooding. As always, some might say. The Innkeeper, always a steady source of good advice and comfort, was polishing a glass. Nobody else was there, not this early. He waited for the Innkeeper to make a comment, or a question, or a wisecrack. Anything to break the silence.

"Rough night, Neil? You look like you haven't slept. Are you okay?"

"..." Neil paused to recollect his thoughts. "Fable and I..." Neil coughed. The Innkeeper was busying themselves with other tasks, but Neil knew that they were just giving him the time he needed. There wasn't a rush.

"We were in a fight. I guess."

"You guess?"

"I... no, I just ran away. Are they here?" Neil whispered.

"No, they must have headed home after close. I only have Archi and Melli staying here tonight. How are you feeling?"

"I'm not sure." Neil stopped for a second. "They headed home? I... we were out stargazing. Are you sure they're ok? Have you seen them?" Neil's mind raced with a million possibilities. Maybe they got lost? No, they'd never get lost... Maybe they would? Maybe they got attacked by a bear, and he was too far away to help. He buried his face into his hands, leaned into the bar. It was his fault.

"Are you okay?" Melli was tugging at his sleeves, reaching up from the floor. She had morning voice, still in her pajamas, carrying a doll of Rufus, the Sheepfish. "Just breathe, Neil." She kept a hand on him as she eased onto her spot on the bar. Her large eyes trained on him.

"Fable. They might be in danger."

"What happened?"

"I don't know! Anything could have happened, they could have..."

"Hey. Start with the facts, tell me what you know and we can go from there. We're detectives, remember?"

Neil stopped. Remembered what he had worked on with Clay. He laid his hands on his legs, planted his feet on the ground, brought his chin up, and breathed. Five seconds out, five seconds in, hold for five. Then again. "Fable. They were with me last night, in the wilderness. They might be in trouble." What he was feeling was written all over his face, he was sure. How worried he was.

Melli smiled, beamed even. Maybe she was keeping the mood up, or maybe this is just how she is. "Sounds like a case for Great Detective Melli! Let's go see what happened, assistant!" Neil looked to Melli. She had done a lot of growing over the past couple months. It felt strange to look up to such a young kid, but they've been teaching each other a lot since they've met. "I'll change into my detective gear, you better be ready by the time I get back down!" Melli punched Neil on the shoulder, playfully, then scampered up the stairs on all fours, leaving the ersatz Rufus behind.

"Ow!" Neil grinned. He picked up the doll, fiddled with it. He was rather proud of this one. It's made with his wool. Seems to have held up well, even with Melli's hijinks. He ran his fingers over the surface, and fidgeted with the legs.

After a moment of silence, The Innkeeper chimed in. "Sounds like a *quest*. Do you need a drink? I know just the one."

Neil nodded.

The Innkeeper quickly made a Spoken Heart. Neil would never admit it, but it's become his favorite drink.

---

They walked in silence towards the spot, each of Neil's long strides matched by two of Melli's. It was a companionable silence, a focused one. Neil had to point out a few hidden shortcuts and tracks, but Melli was comfortable in this terrain. It was a spring morning cold, the chill while the sun rises. Dew collected on their boots as they strode past.

"We're here." There wasn't a huge scene of destruction. Everything was basically as Neil left it. Even the track he made as he ran away. Coward.

"Neil, what happened?"

He recounted the events of last night. Melli kept herself busy with looking around, but had an ear trained on him as he leaned against a tree, broodingly.

"Fable tried to follow you, but gave up around... here. Looks like they just went home. Nothing terrible happened!" Melli shrugged, saw Neil still rather glum. "Don't worry, they know what's up!"

"What should we do?"

Melli paused for a second. "You", jabbing a finger at Neil's midsection "need to go talk to them. Come, let's go!" 

Melli strode off on a trot, following Fable's trail.

Neil wasn't used to thinking about other people. For almost his whole adult life, it was just him. He needed to make things right. It's not some big evil monster, it was just them two. But he'd never felt such fear in his whole life. He could handle big evil monsters, but this was a whole new territory.

---

Fable's place was a small cottage, nestled amongst a copse of trees, a few miles from the Wayfarer's Inn.

"They got home safe, but they might not have gotten much sleep either!" Melli looked up at Neil, grabbed his forearm with both her paws. "Will you be ok by yourself?"

Neil nodded.

"Well... I'll be back at the flat. Let me know how it goes, okay?" She punched his arm, playfully. "Go get em, tiger!"

Then, it was just Neil standing outside of Fable's cottage. Absently, he found himself braiding his own hair. Almost like he was just hoping that Fable would open the door of their own accord and find him standing there and then everything would be fine after that. But he resolved. If he wanted this... then he needed to act like it. He brought his hand up, and knocked on the door.

Some minutes went by, then he knocked again. The door opened, and Fable was there, wearing a plain white shift.

"Hey. I-"

Fable smiled, then lunged forward into a hug. Neil couldn't do anything but hug them back, his arms resting on their back. Fable broke it first, took a step back. Their eyes were puffy, their hair was messy. They looked down, ashamed, and held one arm with the other. Tearfully, they began "I'm sorry.."

"No, I'm sorry." Neil stepped forward, and kissed them on the forehead, and pressed their head against his chest. "Can I come in?"

Almost in a whisper, still buried in his chest, Fable replied, "yeah.."

---

The cottage wasn't such an unknown place for Neil now. It was comfortable. He knew where things were. He led Fable to the laid out futon, bedsheets still astray. Fable sat on the futon, and pulled a blanket over themselves. Neil went through one of the nearby drawers, and picked out a hairbrush, started brushing their hair.

Fable closed their eyes, focused on the sensation. Listened to the brush glide through their hair, taking the worries from their bones as well as the knots from their hair. "I've always admired your hair. It's perfect. I enjoy helping you keep it that way." Neil started braiding it, too. One of their little rituals. Their symbol, their promise.

"You're always so gentle with me. It's like you're afraid you'll break me."

"I am." A pause. "I feel the same way, too."

"That I'll break you?"

"You're gentle with me too. And that." His fingers paused. "I just don't want to hurt you." Neil could feel himself tearing up. It was hard to talk about this. About his *feelings*. About *them*, as a couple.

"I didn't mean to make things hard."

"You don't." Neil wanted to end his sentence there. To be terse, to be vague, to be *closed off*. He couldn't. Not this time. "You make things so easy for me. Before, everything was always up in the air. Who I was, where I was, what I was doing, what I wanted. All I want now is..." He trailed off, and blushed.

"I get it. You don't have to say anything you don't want to." Fable reached up to their cheek, and wiped away a tear.

The braids were done. With nothing else to do with his hands, Neil wrapped his arms around Fable and laid back into the futon, pulling them with him. They laid like that for a bit. Then, almost out of nowhere, like he couldn't resist the words falling out of his lips, Neil blurted out "I want to be with you, Fable. That's it. Trust me."

Fable couldn't stop themselves from crying. Neil, too. At some point, it turned into laughter, from the emotional release, the ecstacy of connection. They found themselves face to face, foreheads almost touching, hands caressing the other's cheek. Fable's scales under Neil's hand, and Neil's tattoo being traced by Fable's fingertip.

---

Neil was in the small kitchenette, overlooking Fable. They had both decided to get a few extra hours of sleep. He just woke a little earlier. Being as quiet as he possibly could (which he was well trained to do), he brought out a kettle, two mugs, and the prototype Instant Quincy's Hot Chocolate mix that the Innkeeper had given them to try out. He set the kettle on the magical stove to boil, and spooned some amount into each mug. He watched Fable breathe deeply as they slept. 

When the kettle finished, Neil poured the water into the mugs, stirred them. The smell was just like having a fresh one made at the Inn. Fable opened their eyes, and wiped the sleep from them. "You made hot chocolate." They smiled.

Neil brought the mugs to the small table by the window, had a seat, and took a sip. Tastes pretty much the same, too. Warming. Comfortable. He stared out the window, at the Wayfarer's Inn. Somehow, that place had brought so many of them together. He'd have to thank the Innkeeper properly some time.

Fable joined him at the chair opposite and took a sip from the other mug. "It's good. It's exactly like the Innkeeper makes it." Neil nodded, in appreciation and agreement. They sat, drinking their hot chocolates and watching each other. It was an easy, lazy, late morning, in comparison to the turmoil of last night. Neil felt his shoulders fall and relax, but felt himself blushing. It was like there was something bubbling directly up from his vocal chords, something he couldn't stop. It wasn't like he wanted to stop it, anyway.

"I love you too."
